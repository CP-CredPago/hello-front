# hello-front

_Please read these instructions carefully._

There are 3 folders in this project:
* **hs-back** is a project that contains a simple backend application built with _json-server_, hs-back contains routes to retrieve and create _people_ and _properties_. It also have a README file with more information.

* **hs-front** is an empty folder where you must scaffold you application that consumes _hs-back_ endpoints.

* **assets** is folder where you can find all the assets from the layout.

## Problem
We are creating the House Solution platform where real estate brokers can create properties and renters. At the end of the process, the real estate broker must have the analysis result of the registration.

## Mission
Your mission is to scaffold the application and implement the layout available at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bBjCppWNfrtZLi7zbfAtF9/Frontend-Desafio-Prototipo?node-id=0%3A1).

To scaffold your application, you can use one of the following React frameworks/libraries:
* Next.js
* Create React App

If you need to make any changes to help you debugging (such as adding logs or catching exceptions) we suggest you keep them so we can understand your thought process.

Feel free to use tools and libraries like ESLint, Prettier, Chakra UI and Styled Components.

## Solutions

We'll accept the following solution:

* A Web application built with given desktop layout and integrated with the given hs-back routes.
### Plus!
Did you feel inspired? Feel free to implement any of the following solutions:

* Mobile layout in a responsive application.

* Docker Compose file _or_ another similar container orchestration solution that deploys the application on a host running a modern Linux distribution _or_ on the AWS cloud.
## Expectations

* Whether the solution works or not
* How _easy_ it isÂ to deploy the solution
* How _resilient_ it is (e.g. if the backend takes a few more seconds to response the request, does the application shows up components to increase or to not break user experience? If the backend returns an error, does the application shows up any component to prevent the screen or user experience to break?)

Suppose that a _junior_ developer (who has access to most common Linux distributions) will try to run your solution. Would they be able to install all requirements and run it easily? Would they be able to verify that it works? Should any problems arise (e.g. a package is missing), would they be able to identify and fix it?

We don't expect a production-grade solution, but we expect you to show that you'd be able to build a production-grade application given enough tools and time.

## Result

Please do **not** fork this repository and do **not** publish your solution online!

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! Also, we expect this problem to take some hours at most, but please do get in touch if you need more time to provide a good solution! It is far better than delivering something that does not work :)
